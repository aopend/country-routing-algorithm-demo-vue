# Vue moronic stuff

- Vue2 and Vue3 is nothing alike, and it is painful to find an answer for your version. Sometimes you just find and answer and don't know which version is it
- You cannot inject a component into the `<template>` after render
- Documentation sucks.
  - No indication of file, which component, what type. It's always some sort of assumption game
- whole v-bind and v-model thing is just so impractical. 
  - Unbelievable that this is suggested in official docs: `this.$emit('update:selectedCountryCode',value)`. It `update:selectedCountryCode` part looks like some work-around.
